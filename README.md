## Credits
This site is heavily based on the work done by Chetan Verma, with some customization by myself to fit my personal work. All aspects of the site are permitted by written permission from the original author and were obtained from portfolio templates distributed by MUI. The author referenced a link to fund them and in deference to their work I have listed that link below:
